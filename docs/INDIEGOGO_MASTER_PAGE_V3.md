# Indiegogo Master Page — V3 (Publish Ready)

## Hero
### Headline
A church-first platform for weekly communication, events, prayer, and member engagement.

### Subheadline
Help us launch Flock Social with real churches now — replacing fragmented tools with one unified church operating layer.

### Primary CTA
Back this project

---

## Why This Exists
Churches are still forced to patch together multiple disconnected apps for announcements, events, prayer engagement, and follow-up.
That fragmentation lowers consistency, weakens engagement, and increases operational load on leaders.

Flock Social is built to fix that directly.

---

## The Problem
- Communication is fragmented across channels and tools.
- Weekly engagement consistency is hard to maintain.
- Event participation and follow-through are difficult to track.
- Leadership lacks role-aware operational workflows.
- Most tools can’t prove outcomes with transparent metrics.

---

## The Solution: Flock Social
### Member Experience
- Home
- Discover
- Prayer
- Groups
- Flock (church identity layer)

### Leadership Experience
- Weekly announcement pushes
- Event publishing + RSVP workflows
- Church role model: Member, Group Leader, Pastor/Staff, Church Admin
- Role-audit visibility + admin observability

### Metrics & Accountability
- Pilot KPI endpoint
- CSV export for reporting
- Church-scoped trend deltas
- Weekly KPI reporting process

---

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Pilot onboarding drop-off** → checklist ownership + weekly review rhythm
- **Weak weekly usage** → cadence workflows + KPI monitoring loop
- **Role misconfiguration** → role controls + audit visibility + guardrails
- **Leaderboard gaming risk** → leaderboard remains disabled until anti-gaming controls are complete

---

## FAQ
**Is this only for large churches?**
No. Pilot design supports small, medium, and growth-stage churches.

**Is this replacing church management software?**
Not initially. Flock focuses on communication, engagement, and community operations.

**How will progress be shown?**
Weekly transparency updates with shipped work, KPI snapshots, and next actions.

---

## Backer Commitment
We commit to weekly transparent updates:
- what shipped,
- what pilot metrics show,
- what changed,
- what we execute next.

If you believe churches deserve better tools for community and communication, back Flock Social and help us launch with real churches now.
