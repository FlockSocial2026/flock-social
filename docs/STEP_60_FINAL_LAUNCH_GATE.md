# Step 60 — Final Launch Gate (Go/No-Go)

Date: 2026-02-23

## Objective
Create a strict pre-launch gate with pass/fail criteria and a launch-day operator checklist to reduce execution risk.

## Deliverables
1. Go/No-Go decision framework
2. Pre-launch readiness checklist with pass criteria
3. Launch-day hour-by-hour operator runbook
4. First 48-hour monitoring and response protocol

## Exit Criteria
- Every critical gate has explicit owner + pass state
- Launch window decision process is unambiguous
- Day-of operations can run without interpretation ambiguity
