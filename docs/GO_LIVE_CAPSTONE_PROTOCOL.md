# Go-Live Capstone Protocol

## Purpose
Provide a single operating standard for launch activation, response, and stabilization across the first 72 hours.

## Control Rules
1. Do not trigger launch until all P0 validations pass.
2. Log every major send/decision/incident in real time.
3. Apply rapid objection patches within SLA.
4. Maintain checkpoint cadence at T+1h, T+3h, T+6h, T+12h, T+24h, T+48h, T+72h.
5. Complete 72h transition brief before switching to steady-state cadence.

## Canonical Inputs
- Launch activation trigger checklist
- T0-T+24 command script
- Realtime KPI watchboard
- Incident log + escalation protocol
- Day-2 optimization activation brief
