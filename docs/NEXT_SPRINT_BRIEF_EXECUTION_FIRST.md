# Next Sprint Brief (Execution-First)

## Sprint Goal
Convert the prepared operating system into live outcomes: launch execution, real outreach movement, and first pilot onboarding starts.

## Sprint Priorities (ordered)
1. Launch unblock completion (URL, pricing lock, media final)
2. Launch wave execution + day-1/day-2 monitoring
3. Outreach batch execution + discovery scheduling
4. First qualified church onboarding kickoff
5. Week-1 KPI + executive summary publication

## Key Metrics
- Outreach sent (target: 10-15)
- Discovery calls scheduled (target: 4-6)
- Qualified churches (target: 2-3)
- First onboarding initiated (target: >=1)

## Risks
- Delayed launch asset finalization
- Slow outreach response velocity
- Onboarding owner bandwidth constraints
