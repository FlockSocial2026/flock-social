# Pilot Outreach Script + Discovery Call Agenda

## Outreach Script (Email/DM)
Subject: Pilot invitation — church communication + engagement platform

Hi <Name>,

I’m building Flock Social, a platform designed for real church operations: weekly pushes, events, prayer, and member engagement in one place.

We’re inviting a small set of churches into a 6-8 week pilot. We’ll support setup directly, provide weekly KPI reporting, and use your feedback to shape the product roadmap.

Would you be open to a short intro call this week?

– Danie
