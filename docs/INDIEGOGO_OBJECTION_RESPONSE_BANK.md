# Indiegogo Objection-Response Bank

## Objection: "Is this just another social app?"
Response: Flock is church-first by design, combining member community with leadership operations (announcements, events, roles, observability) in one system.

## Objection: "Do you have anything built yet?"
Response: Yes — core MVP, moderation stack, Flock role/events/announcement foundation, pilot metrics, and onboarding/recruitment operations assets are already shipped.

## Objection: "How will you prove progress?"
Response: Weekly updates with shipped work, pilot KPIs, and next actions; plus church-scoped reporting instrumentation is already in place.

## Objection: "Is this only for big churches?"
Response: No. Pilot cohort is designed for small, medium, and growth-stage churches.

## Objection: "Why back now?"
Response: Early backing directly accelerates pilot onboarding and helps shape the product before broader rollout.
