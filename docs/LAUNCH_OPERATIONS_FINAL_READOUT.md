# Launch Operations Final Readout

## Executive Summary
All major planning and control artifacts across Steps 55-77 are in place. Execution readiness is high, with remaining go-live dependencies tied to live inputs (URL/pricing/media finalization).

## Readout Highlights
- Campaign narrative and conversion stack: complete
- Launch command and fallback systems: complete
- Post-launch and pilot command systems: complete
- Remaining live dependencies: URL propagation, final pricing lock, final media verification

## Immediate Recommendation
Proceed into live launch sequence once the remaining live dependencies are cleared and signed in the readiness consolidation sheet.
