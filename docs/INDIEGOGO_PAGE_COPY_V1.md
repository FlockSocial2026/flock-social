## Headline
Build the church-first social platform for real community, prayer, and leadership operations.

## Subheadline
Flock Social helps churches run weekly communication, events, and member engagement in one place — while giving members a meaningful faith-centered community experience.

## Why We’re Building This
Churches are doing important work with disconnected tools.
Announcements happen in one place, event tracking in another, prayer engagement elsewhere, and leadership teams are left stitching it together every week.

We built Flock Social to fix that.

## The Problem
- Communication is fragmented across multiple apps and channels.
- Weekly engagement is inconsistent and hard to sustain.
- Event participation is difficult to track and improve.
- Leadership teams lack role-based tools built for church operations.
- Most products can’t prove impact with clear metrics.

## The Solution
Flock Social combines member-facing community and church operations into one platform:

### Member Experience
- Home
- Discover
- Prayer
- Groups
- Flock (church identity layer)

### Church Leadership Experience
- Weekly announcement pushes
- Event publishing + RSVP workflows
- Role-based controls (Member, Group Leader, Pastor/Staff, Church Admin)
- Role audit visibility + admin observability

### Metrics & Accountability
- Pilot KPI endpoint with CSV export
- Church-scoped trend deltas
- Weekly reporting templates and pilot playbooks

## What We’ve Already Built
This is not idea-stage.
Major shipped milestones already include:
- Core social MVP features (auth, feed, likes, comments, follows, notifications, discover, profiles)
- Moderation pipeline with queue, audits, summaries, cron alerts, dedupe, and webhook delivery
- Flock API foundation and admin interfaces
- Role management + audit trail
- Pilot onboarding, activation, and recruitment operations assets
- Indiegogo-ready fundraising proof pack and milestone timeline

## Risks & Mitigations
### Risk: Low pilot onboarding completion
Mitigation: strict onboarding checklist, owner accountability, weekly review cadence.

### Risk: Weak weekly usage
Mitigation: enforced communication rhythms + reminder workflows + KPI monitoring.

### Risk: Role misconfiguration
Mitigation: role assignment controls + role audit visibility + admin guardrails.

### Risk: Feature gaming (leaderboards)
Mitigation: leaderboard remains disabled until anti-gaming controls are complete.

## FAQ
### Is this only for large churches?
No. Pilot design includes small, medium, and growth-stage churches.

### Is this replacing church management software?
Not initially. Flock focuses on communication, engagement, and community operations.

### How will you show progress?
We commit to weekly updates with shipped work, pilot metrics, and next actions.

### When will prayer leaderboard launch?
After anti-gaming and moderation controls are completed and tested.

## Weekly Update Commitment
We will publish transparent weekly updates including:
- features shipped
- pilot activity and KPI snapshots
- problems discovered
- next-week execution plan

## Call to Action
