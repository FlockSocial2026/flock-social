# Step 61 — Campaign Rehearsal Sprint

Date: 2026-02-23

## Objective
Run a full dry-run simulation of Indiegogo launch operations so launch-day execution is deterministic and low-risk.

## Deliverables
1. Launch rehearsal script and checklist
2. Mock Go/No-Go decision record
3. Dry-run announcement outputs
4. Rehearsal findings + fixes log

## Exit Criteria
- All launch-day critical steps are rehearsed at least once
- Fail points are documented with mitigations
- Go/No-Go matrix can be filled end-to-end without ambiguity
