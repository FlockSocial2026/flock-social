# Indiegogo Campaign Narrative (Draft)

## Headline
A church-first social platform built for real community and real church operations.

## Core Story
Most churches are forced to patch together multiple tools for announcements, events, prayer engagement, and member communication.
Flock Social unifies these into one platform designed for both members and church leadership.

## The Problem
- Fragmented communication stacks
- Low consistency in weekly engagement
- Weak event follow-through and RSVP visibility
- Limited role-based tools for pastors/admin teams

## The Solution
Flock Social provides:
- Member surfaces: Home, Discover, Prayer, Groups, Flock
- Church ops layer: announcements, events, role controls, admin observability
- Pilot metrics + reporting endpoints for measurable outcomes

## Why We’re Credible
- Core MVP social stack already shipped
- Moderation + production hardening completed
- Church-layer APIs and admin scaffolds implemented
- Pilot ops/recruitment assets prepared for immediate execution

## What Funding Unlocks
1. Pilot cohort execution (3-5 churches)
2. Metrics-driven iteration loop
3. Product polish + scalability for wider launch

## Backer Promise
Weekly transparent updates with shipped work, pilot metrics, and lessons learned.
