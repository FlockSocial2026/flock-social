# Step 75 — Execution Reset & Next Sprint Brief

Date: 2026-02-23

## Objective
Close the current planning/build cycle (Steps 55-74) and create a practical next-sprint brief focused on real-world execution inputs and measurable output delivery.

## Deliverables
1. Cycle closeout summary (what is complete vs pending)
2. Next sprint brief (execution-first)
3. Immediate unblock checklist (live launch blockers)
4. Sprint entry criteria and Definition of Done
5. Operator kickoff script for Day 1

## Exit Criteria
- Team has one clear sprint start brief with explicit priorities
- Remaining blockers are translated into first-action tasks
- Sprint success is measurable with unambiguous DoD
