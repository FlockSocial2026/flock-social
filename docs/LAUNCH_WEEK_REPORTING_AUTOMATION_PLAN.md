# Launch Week Reporting Automation Plan

## Goal
Standardize reporting snapshots so daily updates are fast, consistent, and decision-ready.

## Automation Candidates
1. Pull daily metrics into a single rollup sheet
2. Generate end-of-day summary draft from scorecard fields
3. Flag threshold breaches based on KPI guardrails
4. Pre-fill weekly summary template with cumulative values

## Cadence
- Daily snapshot: EOD
- Weekly rollup: Day 7

## Manual Override
- Any anomaly requires manual note before publish
