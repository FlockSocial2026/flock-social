## First 10 Drafts

### 1) Warm Intro — Direct Value
Hi {{contact_name}}, I’m building Flock Social to help churches like {{church_name}} run weekly pushes, events, and member engagement in one place. We’re opening a small 6-8 week pilot cohort and I’d love to invite your church. Open to a short intro call {{slot_option_1}} or {{slot_option_2}}?

### 2) Warm Intro — Pain Point
Hi {{contact_name}}, a lot of churches are juggling announcements/events across too many tools. We built Flock Social to simplify that for teams like {{church_name}}. We’re inviting a few churches into a pilot and would love your feedback. Open to a quick call this week?

### 3) Warm Intro — Partnership
Hi {{contact_name}}, we’re partnering with a small set of churches to shape Flock Social early. It combines prayer/community + staff communication workflows in one platform. Would {{church_name}} be open to a short pilot-fit conversation?

### 4) Local Outreach — Event Focus
Hi {{contact_name}}, I noticed how active {{church_name}} is with events. We built Flock Social to improve weekly communication + event coordination (including RSVP tracking). We’re selecting pilot churches now. Could we do a 20-minute intro?

### 5) Local Outreach — Engagement Focus
Hi {{contact_name}}, if {{specific_pain}} is a challenge at {{church_name}}, Flock Social is built specifically for that. We’re running a short pilot with direct setup support and KPI reporting. Open to discussing fit?

### 6) Local Outreach — Leadership Angle
Hi {{contact_name}}, we’re helping church leaders reduce communication friction while improving engagement consistency. I think {{church_name}} could be a great fit for our first pilot cohort. Are you available for a quick intro call?

### 7) Lighthouse Target — Vision
Hi {{contact_name}}, we’re building Flock Social as a church-first operating layer (announcements, events, prayer, member engagement). We’d value having a leadership-driven church like {{church_name}} in the first cohort. Interested in an intro?

### 8) Lighthouse Target — Outcomes
Hi {{contact_name}}, pilot churches receive direct onboarding support and weekly KPI snapshots to measure what’s working. If {{church_name}} is open, we’d love to include you in this first wave.

### 9) Follow-Up #1 (Day 2)
Hi {{contact_name}} — quick follow-up in case this got buried. We’re inviting a small number of churches into an early Flock Social pilot to improve weekly communication + events + engagement. Open to a short call {{slot_option_1}} or {{slot_option_2}}?

### 10) Follow-Up #2 (Day 5)
Hi {{contact_name}}, last touchpoint from me for now — if helpful, I can share a one-page pilot overview and setup checklist for {{church_name}}. If it looks relevant, we can schedule a quick intro.

## Next Action
Fill real contact/church fields in `docs/PILOT_BATCH1_EXECUTION_SHEET.md` and replace tokens above before sending.
