## The Problem
Church leaders are juggling too many disconnected tools for announcements, events, prayer engagement, and follow-up. This creates inconsistent communication and lower engagement over time.

## The Solution: Flock Social
Flock Social unifies church community and church operations in one platform:
- Member surfaces: Home, Discover, Prayer, Groups, Flock
- Leadership tools: announcements, event workflows, role-based permissions, admin visibility
- Metrics layer: pilot KPIs, exports, trend deltas

## Why We Can Execute
This is not concept-stage. We’ve already shipped core MVP features, moderation infrastructure, role controls, pilot metrics endpoints, and recruitment/onboarding operations assets.

## 90-Day Plan
1. Activate first pilot cohort (3-5 churches)
2. Run weekly KPI loops and product iteration
3. Publish outcomes and expand to next cohort

## What Backers Enable
Your support directly funds pilot execution, reliability hardening, church onboarding support, and rapid iteration from real-world usage.
