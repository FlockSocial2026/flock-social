# Step 80 — Launch Readiness Capstone & Go-Live Protocol

Date: 2026-02-23

## Objective
Finalize a capstone launch protocol that unifies all prior launch artifacts (Steps 55-79) into a single go-live control standard.

## Deliverables
1. Go-live capstone protocol
2. Final pre-go-live validation matrix
3. 72-hour command timeline (T0 to T+72)
4. Launch governance checkpoint protocol
5. Post-72h transition brief template

## Exit Criteria
- One capstone protocol governs launch behavior end-to-end
- Go-live validation is explicit and measurable
- First 72h command cadence is fully operationalized
