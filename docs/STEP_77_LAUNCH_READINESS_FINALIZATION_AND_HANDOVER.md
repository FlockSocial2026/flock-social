# Step 77 — Launch Readiness Finalization & Handover

Date: 2026-02-23

## Objective
Finalize all launch-readiness artifacts into a single handover-ready package that can be executed by operator(s) with zero ambiguity.

## Deliverables
1. Final readiness consolidation sheet
2. Handover command checklist (operator handoff)
3. Live-launch fallback playbook
4. Post-launch first-week ownership map
5. Launch completion signoff template

## Exit Criteria
- One canonical handover entrypoint exists
- Fallback scenarios are predefined and actionable
- Ownership for week-1 post-launch is explicit
