# Step 64 — Final Prelaunch Closure

Date: 2026-02-23

## Objective
Close remaining prelaunch gaps by creating a final closure packet that ensures all launch blockers are either resolved or explicitly deferred with mitigation.

## Deliverables
1. Prelaunch closure checklist
2. Blocking item resolution log
3. Launch approvals record
4. Day-0 communication execution tracker

## Exit Criteria
- Every blocker has a clear resolved/deferred status
- Launch approvals are explicitly recorded
- Day-0 communication operations are trackable in one sheet
