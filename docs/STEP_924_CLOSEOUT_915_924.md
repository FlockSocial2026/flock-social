# Step 924 Closeout — Steps 915-924

## Scope Delivered
- Admin reminder draft bridges from event attendance panels
- Maybe/not-going follow-up draft shortcuts
- Events sorting, filtering, and personal RSVP filtering
- API-backed event query filtering/sorting
- Dashboard shortcuts into events workflows
- CSV exports (admin attendance and events current view)
- Message quick templates for outreach speed
- Event reminder automation runbook

## Operational Outcome
Church admins can now run a complete attendance operations loop:
1. Review attendance metrics
2. Trigger reminders and follow-ups
3. Export views for weekly reporting
4. Iterate using runbook cadence

## Next Suggested Block (925+)
- Automate reminder scheduling (T-72/T-24/T-2) with cron-backed dispatch
- Add message send logs tied to event id
- Surface conversion trendline (maybe -> going) in admin metrics
