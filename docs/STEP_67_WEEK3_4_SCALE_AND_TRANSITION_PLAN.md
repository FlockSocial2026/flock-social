## Deliverables

3. Pilot conversion playbook (interested backers/churches to onboarding)
4. Weekly reporting cadence for scale phase

## Exit Criteria
- Week 3-4 priorities are explicit and executable
- Growth loops are tied to measurable KPIs
- Pilot conversion workflow is clear and owner-assigned
