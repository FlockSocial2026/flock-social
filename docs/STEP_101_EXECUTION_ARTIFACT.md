# Step 101 Execution Artifact

## Kickoff Checklist
- [ ] Confirm launch dependencies are clear (URL/pricing/media)
- [ ] Open command center + watchboard + logs
- [ ] Confirm first checkpoint times (T+1h/T+3h/T+6h)
- [ ] Confirm owner + backup coverage

## Priority Card
- Primary goal: Execute launch sequence cleanly
- Secondary goal: Capture high-quality signal for day-2 optimization
- Failure condition: unresolved Sev1 or missing critical send logs

## Completion Definition
Step 101 is complete when kickoff checklist is run, ownership is confirmed, and first checkpoint schedule is active.
