# Indiegogo Live Command Playbook

## Mission
Operate the campaign with high responsiveness, tight decision loops, and transparent daily reporting.

## Command Rhythm
### Morning
- Review prior 24h metrics
- Identify top traffic/conversion channel
- Select one optimization experiment for the day

### Midday
- Check funding velocity vs target
- Review objections and FAQ gaps
- Execute channel reallocation if needed

### Evening
- Publish short momentum or learning update
- Log end-of-day metrics and decisions
- Set next-day priority actions

## Core Principles
1. Respond fast to repeated objections.
2. Double down on channels that convert.
3. Keep updates transparent and frequent.
4. Avoid changing too many variables at once.

## Decision Cadence
- Minor copy/channel tweaks: same day
- Perks/pricing changes: only with explicit approval
- Strategic narrative changes: at daily review only
