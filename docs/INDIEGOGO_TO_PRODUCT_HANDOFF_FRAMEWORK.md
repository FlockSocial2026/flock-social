# Indiegogo to Product Handoff Framework

## Purpose
Ensure campaign momentum turns into execution outcomes (pilot onboarding, product iteration, and backer trust updates).

## Handoff Streams
### 1) Backer Commitments
- Convert perks/support tiers into fulfillment tasks
- Define due dates and communication cadence

### 2) Pilot Intake
- Move qualified churches from campaign pipeline into onboarding queue
- Assign owner + kickoff windows

### 3) Product Iteration
- Feed pilot/campaign objections into product backlog
- Prioritize based on conversion/retention impact

### 4) Transparency Loop
- Continue weekly progress updates post-campaign
- Tie updates to measurable outcomes (KPI deltas + shipped work)
