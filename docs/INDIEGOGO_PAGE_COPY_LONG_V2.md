## Churches Need Better Infrastructure
Churches are forced to patch communication and engagement across multiple disconnected tools. Weekly announcements get scattered, events lose momentum, follow-up falls through, and leadership teams carry the operational burden.

Flock Social exists to solve this directly.

## What Flock Social Delivers
### Member Experience
- Home, Discover, Prayer, Groups, Flock
- Faith-centered social connection and ongoing engagement

### Leadership Experience
- Weekly congregation pushes
- Events + RSVP workflows
- Church-scoped role model (Member, Group Leader, Pastor/Staff, Church Admin)
- Role audit visibility and admin observability

### Measurement Layer
- Pilot KPI endpoint
- CSV exports for reporting
- Church-scoped trend deltas

## Proof We’re Building, Not Pitching
Major implementation milestones are already shipped across product, moderation, role controls, pilot instrumentation, and outreach operations. We’ve built the foundation required to execute real pilot cohorts immediately.

## What Happens After Funding
### First 90 Days
- Execute first outreach wave and discovery calls
- Onboard 3-5 pilot churches
- Run weekly KPI reporting and feedback loops
- Ship improvements from real church usage

### Backer Transparency
We’ll publish weekly updates covering:
- what shipped,
- pilot metrics,
- blockers found,
- next actions.

## Why Support This Now
Most communities are underserved by software that truly understands their operational reality. Flock Social is built specifically for church context — not retrofitted from generic social tools.

Your support helps move this from strong foundation to real pilot impact.
