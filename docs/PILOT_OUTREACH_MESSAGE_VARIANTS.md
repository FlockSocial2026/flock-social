# Pilot Outreach Message Variants

## Variant A — Direct Value
Hi <Name>, I’m building Flock Social to help churches run weekly communication, events, and member engagement in one place. We’re opening a small 6-8 week pilot cohort and I’d love to invite your church. Open to a quick 20-min intro this week?

## Variant B — Pain-Point Framing
Hi <Name>, many churches are juggling announcements, events, and follow-up across too many tools. We built Flock Social as a church-first operating layer to simplify this. We’re inviting a few churches into an early pilot. Interested in a short intro call?

## Variant C — Partnership Framing
Hi <Name>, we’re partnering closely with a small group of churches to shape Flock Social, a platform for prayer/community + staff communication workflows. You’d get direct setup support and weekly KPI snapshots during the pilot. Want to explore fit on a quick call?

## SMS/DM Short Form
Hey <Name> — building a church-first platform for weekly pushes/events/member engagement. Running a small pilot cohort now. Open to a quick intro call this week?
