# Indiegogo Video Script (60-90s) — V1

## 0:00-0:10 (Hook)
Churches are doing life-changing work with disconnected tools that create communication chaos.

## 0:10-0:25 (Problem)
Announcements are fragmented, events lose momentum, and leaders spend too much time stitching systems together instead of serving people.

## 0:25-0:45 (Solution)
We built Flock Social: a church-first platform that unifies weekly communication, events, prayer, and member engagement in one place.

## 0:45-1:05 (Proof)
This isn’t just an idea. Core product, moderation, role controls, pilot metrics, and rollout operations are already built.

## 1:05-1:20 (What Funding Unlocks)
Your support helps us onboard pilot churches, ship improvements from real-world usage, and scale toward broader launch.

## 1:20-1:30 (CTA)
If you believe churches deserve better tools for community and communication, back Flock Social and help us launch now.
