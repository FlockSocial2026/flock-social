# Step 63 — Launch Readiness Audit & Handoff

Date: 2026-02-23

## Objective
Finalize a handoff-ready launch audit package that consolidates readiness status, unresolved blockers, and immediate operator actions.

## Deliverables
1. Readiness audit report
2. Blockers and mitigation register
3. Final handoff brief (operator-ready)
4. Launch command handoff checklist

## Exit Criteria
- All launch-critical workstreams are auditable in one package
- Remaining blockers are explicit with owners and deadlines
- A launch operator can execute from handoff docs without ambiguity
