# Indiegogo Rehearsal Findings & Fixes

## Findings
1. Final campaign URL must be inserted across all launch assets before live day.
2. Visual asset export naming convention should be standardized to prevent upload confusion.
3. Perks pricing should be hard-locked in one canonical file prior to T-24h.

## Fixes
- [ ] Replace `{{campaign_link}}` tokens in all launch-facing docs
- [ ] Create `/assets/indiegogo/` naming convention sheet
- [ ] Mark final perks/pricing lock timestamp in go/no-go decision record
