# Indiegogo Roadmap Brief — Flock Social

## Vision
Flock Social is a faith-centered social platform built around local church life, not just generic content feeds.

## Core Value Proposition
- Members: prayer, community, and meaningful connection.
- Churches: weekly communication, events, and congregation engagement tools.
- Leadership: role-based controls (Pastor/Staff/Admin) with publishing and coordination workflows.

## What’s Already Built (Credibility)
- Core social MVP surface (auth/feed/comments/follows/notifications/discover/profiles)
- Moderation stack with reporting, queue, audit exports, summaries, cron alerts, webhook delivery, dedupe
- Flock foundation:
  - church identity layer
  - role model and capability system
  - announcements/events APIs
  - admin publishing scaffolds
  - role-management controls and audit trail

## 90-Day Milestone Plan
### Milestone 1 (Weeks 1-3)
- Productionize Flock schema rollout
- Stabilize role-based flows and pagination
- Church bootstrap + first pilot setup playbook

### Milestone 2 (Weeks 4-7)
- Rich Flock UI (announcement history, event UX, role workflows)
- Notifications/inbox integration for church pushes
- Prayer v2 iteration + moderation safeguards

### Milestone 3 (Weeks 8-12)
- Pilot church cohort (3-5 churches)
- Engagement analytics dashboard baseline
- Testimonial + case-study package for scale funding

## Backer Narrative Hooks
- "Built for real church operations, not retrofitted from secular social apps."
- "Leadership tools + community tools in one platform."
- "Measured pilot outcomes, not just idea-stage mockups."

## KPIs to Show Backers
- Weekly active members per church
- Announcement open/engagement rates
- Event RSVP conversion
- Prayer post engagement
- Group activity retention week-over-week
