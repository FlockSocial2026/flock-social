## What Flock Social Is
Flock Social is a church-first platform that combines member community (prayer, groups, discovery) with leadership operations (weekly pushes, events, role controls).

## Why It Matters
Churches are stuck using disconnected tools for communication and engagement. Flock Social unifies this into one experience built for real church workflows.

## What’s Already Built
- Core social MVP
- Moderation and production hardening
- Flock role/events/announcement foundation
- Pilot metrics and reporting workflows
- Pilot onboarding, activation, and recruitment assets

## What Funding Does
- Launch 3-5 pilot churches
- Run weekly KPI-driven iteration
- Scale product reliability and launch readiness

## Back This Mission
If you want better technology serving church community life, back Flock Social and help us launch pilots now.
