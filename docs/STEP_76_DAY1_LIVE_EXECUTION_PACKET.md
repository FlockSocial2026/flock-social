## Objective
Create a live-use Day-1 command packet that turns the Step 75 sprint brief into timestamped, operator-ready execution blocks.

## Deliverables
1. Hour-by-hour Day-1 live run sheet
2. Launch communication send ledger
3. First-24h incident log template
4. Day-1 closeout report template
5. Day-2 carry-forward action plan template

## Exit Criteria
- Day-1 can run from one packet without interpretation gaps
- Every send/incident/decision has a logging surface
- Day-2 starts with a concrete carry-forward plan
